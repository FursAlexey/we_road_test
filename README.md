## Start the app

```bash
docker compose up
```

## How to interact with the app
The application uses JWT authentication. To test various functionalities based on user roles pre-configured user profiles are available as follows [login - password]:
- admin@weroad.com - Admin
- editor@weroad.com - Editor
- user@weroad.com - User

## Tests
There are existing unit (currency.service.spec.ts) and integration tests (travels.resolver.integration-spec.ts, auth.resolver.integration-spec.ts, users.resolver.integration-spec.ts), serving as examples.
Similar testing patterns can be applied to other sections of the application.

#### Run unit tests
```
docker compose exec backend sh -c 'yarn test'
```

#### Run integration tests
```
docker compose exec backend sh -c 'yarn test:integration'
```

## Description
Create an application composed by two parts (front-end and back-end) with a structure similar to WeRoad.  
This application should manage CRUD operation for travel and tours and simulate a backoffice workflow.

## Glossary
- Travel is the basic, fundamental unit of WeRoad: it contains all the necessary information, like the number of days, the images, title, what's included and everything about its appearance. An example is Jordan 360° or Iceland: hunting for the Northern Lights;
- Tour is a specific dates-range of travel with its own price and details. Jordan 360° may have a tour from 20 to 27 January at €899, another one from 10 to 15 March at €1099 etc. At the end, in WeRoad, you will book a tour, not a travel.

## Goals

#### The back-end project should have:

1. A login endpoint to retrieve the user roles;
2. A private (admin) endpoint to create new users. If you want, this could be a DB seeder. This will mainly be used to generate users for this exercise;
3. A private (admin) endpoint to create new travels;
4. A private (admin) endpoint to create new tours for travel;
5. A private (admin) endpoint to delete a travel;
6. A public (no auth) endpoint to get a list of paginated travels and associated tours. It must return only `public` travels;
7. (optional) A private (editor) endpoint to update a tour;
8. (optional) A public (no auth) endpoint to get a list of paginated tours by the travel `slug` (e.g. all the tours of the travel `foo-bar`). Users can filter (search) the results by `priceFrom`, `priceTo`, `startingDate`, `endingDate`. User can sort the list by `price` asc and desc. They will **always** be sorted, after every additional user-provided filter, by `startingDate` asc.

#### The front-end project should have:
1. A page that allows to interact with the travel end-points described above
3. Roles should be considered in the user interaction within the pages (e.g only admins can delete travel)
4. A page that lists the paginated travels and links to the single travel
5. (optional) A page that lists the paginated tours and links to the single tour
6. (optional) A page that allows to interact with the tour end-points described above

## What we would like to see?
- NestJs and idiomatic syntax (back-end)  
- VueJs (or Nuxt), Vuex (front-end)  
- Automated tests (back-end)  
- GraphQL endpoints (back-end)  
- Usage of ORM  (back-end)  
- Good project setup with linter/formatter (front-end/back-end)

## Notes
- You should provide instructions on how to set up and start the project in local environment
- You are free to organize the project as you prefer, a good project organization is appreciated
- For the front-end part feel free to use the libraries and component libraries you are most proficient with
- We use UUIDs as primary keys instead of incremental IDs, but it's not required for you to use them, although highly appreciated;
- **Tours prices** are integer multiplied by 100: for example, €999 euro will be `99900`, but, when returned to Frontends, they will be formatted (`99900 / 100`);
- **Tours names** inside the `samples` are a kind-of what we use internally, but you can use whatever you want;
- Every `admin` user will also have the `editor` permissions;
- In the `samples` folder you can find JSON files containing fake data to get started with;
- Feel free to add to the project whatever you want!
